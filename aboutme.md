My name is Jimin Han. I have the following interests:

- What motivates people to commit to community-based behaviors such as actions for social-justice/equality and cooperation? 
- Why do people help others?


### My story

To be honest, I'm having some trouble remembering right now, so why don't you just watch [my movie](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Princess_Bride_%28film%29) and it will answer **all** your questions.
